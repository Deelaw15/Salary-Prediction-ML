Salary Insights &amp; Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes salary trends using job posting data from Glassdoor. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) examines factors influencing salaries, including location, industry, company size, and job title. Key insights reveal that larger companies and certain industries offer higher salaries, while senior job roles command the most pay.

Feature Engineering involved encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and selecting relevant predictors to improve model performance. Multiple regression models were tested, with XGBoost achieving the best results (RÂ² = 0.81). Feature importance analysis highlights that company ownership type, sector, and company size are the strongest predictors of salary.

This work provides valuable insights into salary determinants and builds an optimized machine learning model for salary prediction. ðŸš€
